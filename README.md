## Project Overview 


This project uses React to create a book tracking app. It allows the user to categorize books they want to read, are currently reading, and have read. Functionality has been added to allow the books to be searched and moved from shelf to shelf. It has been completed as part of Udacity's React Fundamentals course, and required for the Front-end Development Nanodgree. A template was been provided by Udacity of a static example of the CSS and HTML markup, without any of the React code needed to complete the project.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
